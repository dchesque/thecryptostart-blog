# AI Search Optimization Guide

## Why AI Search Matters

ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI models are becoming major traffic sources.
Unlike Google, they don't always click links - they extract answers and cite your site. Being a "trusted source" for AI models is the new SEO frontier.

## Getting Cited by AI

### 1. Direct Answers (The "Quick Answer" Rule)
AI models look for clear definitions. Write your first paragraph (or the paragraph following an H2) as a direct, standalone answer to the main topic.

*   **Goal**: 40-60 words.
*   **Style**: Factual, objective, and definitive.
*   **Example**: "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries."

### 2. FAQ Schema
We automatically generate FAQ schema for the blog. However, you should include Q&A sections in your content using H2 or H3 titles.
AI models frequently cite FAQ sections because they are already structured for consumption.

### 3. Authority Signals (E-E-A-T)
AI Search engines prioritize content from authors with proven expertise.
*   Ensure every post has a **real author**.
*   The author must have a **complete bio** explaining their crypto background.
*   Link to Twitter/Social profiles for verification.

### 4. Specific Facts & Data
Use numbers, percentages, and specific dates. Generic advice ("Bitcoin has grown a lot") is rarely cited. Factual data ("Bitcoin increased by 150% in 2023") is highly citable.

### 5. Clear Semantic Structure
Use a logical heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3). AI parsers use this to understand the relationship between concepts.

### Target Scores:
*   **80-100 (Excellent)**: Content is highly likely to be extracted and cited by AI.
*   **60-79 (Good)**: Good structure, but could use more specific "citable" data or a better quick answer.
*   **Below 60 (Needs Work)**: Missing meta signals, lacks structure, or author information is incomplete.

## AI Citation Checklist
1. [ ] Does the first paragraph answer the "What is..." or "How to..." clearly?
2. [ ] Are there at least 3-4 specific statistics or dates?
3. [ ] Does the post contain H2/H3 headings?
4. [ ] Is the author bio up to date?
5. [ ] Are there lists (numbered or bulleted)? AI loves lists.
